        <ul>
            <li>I play the drums and enjoy going to live shows. The 3 most recent concerts I attended were Future Islands, Pinback, and Tenacious D.</li>
            <li>I love to travel. Some favorite destinations in the past include Vietnam, Iceland, Costa Rica, Hungary and Ukraine. I even once won a sweepstakes for a free trip to Macau!</li>
            <li>I like trying new things, and will always put in the effort to learn. Some firsts in the last few years: climbing/bouldering, playing Dungeons & Dragons, making craft cocktails at home, mountain biking, taking a Russian History course, and beginning to learn programming!</li>
