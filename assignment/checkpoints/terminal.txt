ls

# 2 - What is the command for changing directories?
cd

# 3 - What is the command for going "up" a folder (to a parent directory)?
cd ..

# 4 - What is a quick way to create a new folder?
mkdir [folder name]

# 5 - What output would you expect when you run the command 'ls' in an empty folder? What about a folder containing files?
ls in an empty folder - no results (nothing will show up).  ls in a folder containing files - every file in folder will show up

# 6 - What is a quick way to create a new file?
touch [filename.filetype]

# 7 - Run 'git --version' in your terminal. What is the output?
git version 2.33.0

# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?
to see the status of any modified files, whether they still need to go to the staging area or if ready to push once committed

# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?
adds the modified files to the staging area.  I believe the "." is like a "select all" modified files in that directory

# 10 - What is the command to push your committed changes to your repo on GitHub?
git push origin main - how I understand it so far, is that push is moving the file, origin is telling it to push it back to where it came from originally, and main is the specific branch
